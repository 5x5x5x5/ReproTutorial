# Data Processing

Now that we have data in online sharing sites, we can start processing it. 
When processing, we want to keep the following best practices in mind:

* Avoid duplication of code: maximize re-use
* Data, code, and documentation are coupled
* Keep track of the full state with version identifiers
* Make sure all analysis is tested


## IPython Notebook

This is one of the best existing resources for reproducible research practices.

* Learn it !
* Love it !

## Our Notebooks

The running instances of Notebooks can be found here
