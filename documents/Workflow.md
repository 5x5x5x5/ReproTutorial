## Create a project

Create a project on the Open Science Framework (http://osf.io). Click on the contributors link, and add a contributor. Edit the project's wiki to reflect the goals of the study.

### Component Layout

Add a "Materials", "Data", "Analysis", and "Report" component. Inherit the project's contributor by importing the parent's contributors.

### Add-ons

Click on the Data component and go to settings. Add a Figshare add-on, Figshare credentials, and connect the images you added during the data collection phase. Under files, you should now see a Figshare folder and the files. Do the same for Analysis, but, instead of Figshare, add Github.
